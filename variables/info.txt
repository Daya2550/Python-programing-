Python Variables
A variable is the name given to a memory location. A value-holding Python variable is also known as an identifier.

Since Python is an infer language that is smart enough to determine the type of a variable, we do not need to specify its type in Python.

Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore, but they can be a group of both letters and digits.

The name of the variable should be written in lowercase. Both Rahul and rahul are distinct variables.

Identifier Naming
Identifiers are things like variables. An Identifier is utilized to recognize the literals utilized in the program. The standards to name an identifier are given underneath.

The variable's first character must be an underscore or alphabet (_).
Every one of the characters with the exception of the main person might be a letter set of lower-case(a-z), capitalized (A-Z), highlight, or digit (0-9).
White space and special characters (!, @, #, %, etc.) are not allowed in the identifier name. ^, &, *).
Identifier name should not be like any watchword characterized in the language.
Names of identifiers are case-sensitive; for instance, my name, and MyName isn't something very similar.
Examples of valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc.
Examples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.
Declaring Variable and Assigning Values
Python doesn't tie us to pronounce a variable prior to involving it in the application. It permits us to make a variable at the necessary time.
In Python, we don't have to explicitly declare variables. The variable is declared automatically whenever a value is added to it.
The equal (=) operator is utilized to assign worth to a variable.
